title: Mitigating Gender Bias in Face Recognition using the von Mises-Fisher Mixture
  Model
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: In spite of the high performance and reliability of deep learning algorithms
  in a wide range of everyday applications, many investigations tend to show that
  a lot of models exhibit biases, discriminating against specific subgroups of the
  population (e.g. gender, ethnicity). This urges the practitioner to develop fair
  systems with a uniform/comparable performance across sensitive groups. In this work,
  we investigate the gender bias of deep Face Recognition networks. In order to measure
  this bias, we introduce two new metrics, BFAR and BFRR, that better reflect the
  inherent deployment needs of Face Recognition systems. Motivated by geometric considerations,
  we mitigate gender bias through a new post-processing methodology which transforms
  the deep embeddings of a pre-trained model to give more representation power to
  discriminated subgroups. It consists in training a shallow neural network by minimizing
  a Fair von Mises-Fisher loss whose hyperparameters account for the intra-class variance
  of each gender. Interestingly, we empirically observe that these hyperparameters
  are correlated with our fairness metrics. In fact, extensive numerical experiments
  on a variety of datasets show that a careful selection significantly reduces gender
  bias.
