title: Continual Learning via Sequential Function-Space Variational Inference
booktitle: Proceedings of the 39th International Conference on Machine Learning
abstract: Sequential Bayesian inference over predictive functions is a natural framework
  for continual learning from streams of data. However, applying it to neural networks
  has proved challenging in practice. Addressing the drawbacks of existing techniques,
  we propose an optimization objective derived by formulating continual learning as
  sequential function-space variational inference. In contrast to existing methods
  that regularize neural network parameters directly, this objective allows parameters
  to vary widely during training, enabling better adaptation to new tasks. Compared
  to objectives that directly regularize neural network predictions, the proposed
  objective allows for more flexible variational distributions and more effective
  regularization. We demonstrate that, across a range of task sequences, neural networks
  trained via sequential function-space variational inference achieve better predictive
  accuracy than networks trained with related methods while depending less on maintaining
  a set of representative points from previous tasks.
